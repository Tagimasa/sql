**Write**: Reflect on your previous work and how you would adjust to include ethics and inequity components. Total length should be a few paragraphs, no more than one page.

Data and data analysis and data management tools, including SQL, are an important component in the formation of social processes, including elements of social justice - equality, information transparency, stable economic development, political correctness.
This directly follows from the nature of data, since it underlie any experience and subsequent decision-making based on this experience - from the most basic actions of a schoolchild to significant research work in science, industry, and the social sphere. This is the foundation for progress.

That is why it is very important at every stage of working with data, from collecting, formatting, creating databases etc. to generating final reports, to take into account and remember the social aspect of all these actions.

The ideal situation is when those working with data ask themselves the question of the ultimate goal of this work, how it will affect the world around them, social groups, individuals, nature, the economy, if there is some element of progress in this or there is a potential element of infringement of someone's rights or harm to someone.

This is a fairly typical problem for people working with data because they often do not see the whole picture, they do part of a small job and may not understand what the consequences are behind what they are doing, how significant it is both in a positive and negative sense, and using this approach, realizing that what you are doing as part of a technical or scientific methodology allows you to achieve significantly better results in building a correct and fair world.

Quite often, with this approach, the question of contradictions arises, for example, openness and transparency and confidentiality of data, this can be considered even as a philosophical question of Yin-Yang, for exaple - commercial data is closed information, on the other hand, a data analyst understands that the more access to data, the more opportunities for the development of society and the economy as a whole, accordingly, it is necessary to find some kind of compromise solution, which can be expressed in volunteering to some extent when a data analyst forms new datasets available to everyone based on open data, similar to how some open source software becomes available to millions of programmers around the world, this can be called a kind of social mission.

An important issue is the moment of data collection because you can mechanically approach the question and the task at hand and not go beyond the scope of this task, but based on your own experience and understanding that if you add some additional data to your analysis and this can be significantly more useful to society, you need to do this and go beyond the scope of narrow tasks.

As sammary, I can say a few things:
1. You need to look at things more broadly, think about the goals and consequences of what you do
2. You need to measure your actions with the goal of a more just world
3. You need to go beyond the narrow tasks set in terms of actions aimed at improving the world
